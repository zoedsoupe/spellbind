a minimalist lambda calculus interpreter, built in elixir. this project is an educational dive into lambda calculus, starting simple with untyped lambda calculus, but with plans to explore typed lambda calculus in the future.

## features

- **basic lambda calculus interpreter:** interprets lambda expressions with elixir, focusing on simplicity and clarity.
- **parser & lexer:** implemented with elixirâ€™s binary pattern matching, for efficient and expressive token handling.
  
## roadmap

- expand the interpreter with evaluation strategies (beta reduction, normal form, etc.)
- gradually introduce types for typed lambda calculus, exploring core concepts in type theory.

## notes

this project is meant for learning and exploration. feedback, contributions, or thoughts are more than welcome, especially from anyone interested in functional programming, theoretical computer science, or elixir.
